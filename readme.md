# What and why?

The documentation for [nvf](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf) is painful to navigate, so I wrote this quick little golang thing that'll add a tree of all options at the top.

> [!NOTE]
> Despite all being links, there isn't actually a piece of documentation to link to for every element, plus there are some leftovers from `htmlq` catching random elements.
